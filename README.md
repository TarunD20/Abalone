# Predicting the age of Abalone using Decision Trees and Random Forests

Abalone is a kind of shellfish which is harvested for food, in some counries it is a delicacy.

Abalone age prediction based on its physical characteristics is a widely studied problem which has seen numerous different learning techniques being applied. One reason for this interest is the commercial value of Abalone and the role age plays in determining this value. In this project, I investigated the application of classification Decision Trees (more specifically the CART algorithm implementation) and Random Forests to determine the age of Abalone. The problem has recasted as a multi-class problem by arranging the age of Abalone into 4 classes.

Main project components:
* Introduction
* Literature Review
* Data Pre-processing
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Visualisations
* Modelling
* Regularisation: Early stopping and Cost-complexity Pruning
* Findings
* Feature importance
* Conclusion

A report was written to consolidate the project components. References are given at the end of the report.
